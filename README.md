# Adversarial Domain Adaptation

The work in this directory was completed as a term project for Fall 2020 MIT 2.165, Robotics. For this project I implemented two 
different types of unsupervised adversarial domain adaptation.
* ADDA - https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Tzeng_Adversarial_Discriminative_Domain_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf
* WDGRL - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.01217.pdf

The two papers were implented in pytorch and evaluated using all bidirectional combinations of the MNIST, USPS and SVHN digits datasets. A full
writeup of the experimental and results can be found here.
